# hello-world
This is my first activity in the platform as I am learning to use it, and to code.

Jaqueline here, working on an activity to get to know the platform and familiarize with coding.
My partner Eduardo is actually pretty good at this, but it does not come as easy for me.
I am waiting to finish the activity to get an "elote", a Mexican snack that I am really going to miss while being in Chile.
